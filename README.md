# Portfolio 1 - Demo 1: Solar System Simulation 🪐

## Description 📚
This demo demonstrates foundational 3D transformations, object hierarchies, and lighting by building a simple solar system model. The scene includes the **Sun, Earth, and Moon**, showcasing orbital motion and rotations.

## Core Features ✨
1. The **Earth orbits the Sun** and the **Moon orbits the Earth**.

2. The Earth is **tilted ~23.5°** to demonstrate seasonal changes.

3. The **Sun acts as the main light source**, illuminating Earth and Moon to show day/night cycles and moon phases.

4. **Materials** and **varying object sizes** are used to distinguish the planets. Yellow is the Sun, green is the Earth, and grey is the Moon.
